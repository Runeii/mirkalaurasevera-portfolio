  "description": "<p>The day the diggers came was the day I lost my home.</p><p>Officially. - It was a relief.</p><p>Of course it all started long, long before the diggers. Until I lost it all.</p><p>My head, My heart, My roots</p><p>After they took my roots – I went on a journey.</p><p>Trying to find new ones, I made my choices now</p><p>with what was left. Holding on to what I wanted to keep and letting go the rest.</p><p>What I want wanted to keep I also wanted to grow into a better version than the core of these moments, captured. Now we’re here decades later, I look at it and it comforts me to know I have these moments, captured - This frozen, absolute reality.</p><p>Evidences of loss.</p><p>By really looking at something, Analysing it - through the hurt you will find reality.</p><p>This is how we all deal with diggers. And everything‘s fine.</p>",
