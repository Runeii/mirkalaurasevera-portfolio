The artist takes no responsibility for any health damage caused by his art. Looking at his art is at your own risk.</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><br>“ It's about us not seeing whether something is real or fake - because we don’t take the time to really look at it, it’s about how our happiness depends on the weather, it’s about trying to make a perfect picture of a sunset but always failing.” - Sunny</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center\">This project is about the fictional Artist „Sunny“ . Sunny creates only images with the sun. His images are so strong that you need to wear UV protection to be able to look at his art. Occasionally he also takes on commissions - for instance to create&nbsp;solar visuals for the weather forecast channel SunTV. The following images document the opening of his latest show: The Sunny Side Up.</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"></p>",
